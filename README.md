# CSCI 331 Database Systems

## Final Project

**Objective:** To convert QueensClassScheduleCurrentSemester Data into an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) design and load the data into a new database.

### Team Members:

- Aleksandra Georgievska
- Nicholas Kong
- Aryeh Richman
- Edwin Wray
- Sigalita Yakubova
- Ahnaf Ahmed

#### Language: T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

### Tools:

- SSMS
- Azure Data Studio
- Docker
- Jupyter Notebook
- Redgate
- Google Cloud Suite
- Discord
- DaVinci Resolve
- ChatGPT

### Implementation:

- Highlighted data anomalies and designed an ERD to divide tables into multiple tiers.
- Created necessary 'Schemas' to organize tables based on their category.
- Created necessary 'UDTs' to provide various attributes more functionality based on the context.
- Added primary and foreign key constraints to implement and maintain the 3rd Normal Form (3NF) in the database.
- Added default and other necessary constraints to keep the data consistent in the database.
- Created stored procedures for various tasks such as loading, deleting, adding and dropping foreign keys, truncating tables, etc.
- Migrated data from the source file into the new database using the stored procedures.

### Outcome:

A T-SQL script that can migrate data from a flat file and transform it into a fully functioning 3NF database.
